- ## Question 2: Discuss how you managed State in your assignment project?
### Ans:
I used useState hook for changing different rendering component value in my assignment. First of all, I have imported useState hook from react. Secondly, defined a state variable and a setter function using the state hook. Thirdly, I use state value within my component's rendering to display the current state. To update the state I called the setter function. Finally, replaced initialvalue and newValue with my actual initial and updated state values.
